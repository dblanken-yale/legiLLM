# 🐛 Debug Filtering Issue

## The Problem

When you select filters (e.g., CT + CLINICAL SKILL-BUILDING + 2025 + Enacted), you're seeing:
- ✅ Enacted bills at the top (correct)
- ❌ Pending bills still showing (WRONG - should be hidden!)

This means the filtering logic is NOT working, and it's only sorting instead.

## 🔍 Let's Debug This

### Step 1: Rebuild and Start
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console (F12)

### Step 3: Apply Your Filters
1. Check **CT** under States
2. Check **CLINICAL SKILL-BUILDING** under Categories
3. Check **2025** under Years
4. Check **Enacted** under Status

### Step 4: Check Console Output

You should see something like:
```
🔄 Recalculating filtered bills...
   Total bills: 59
   Active filters: {states: ['CT'], categories: ['CLINICAL SKILL-BUILDING'], years: ['2025'], statuses: ['Enacted'], ...}
🔍 Filtering: 59 total → X matching
   States filter: CT
   Categories filter: CLINICAL SKILL-BUILDING
   Statuses filter: Enacted
   Years filter: 2025
   Sample filtered bills: [...]
```

### Step 5: Tell Me What You See

**Important questions:**

1. **What does the console say for "Filtering"?**
   - Example: `🔍 Filtering: 59 total → 3 matching`
   - If it says `→ 59 matching`, the filter isn't working at all!
   - If it says `→ 3 matching`, the filter IS working in code

2. **What does the table header say?**
   - Look for `Bills (X)` at the top of the table
   - Does X match the filtered count from console?

3. **How many rows do you ACTUALLY see in the table?**
   - Count them or scroll to see
   - Does this match the filtered count?

4. **Look at the "Sample filtered bills" in console**
   - Do they all have status: "Enacted"?
   - Or do you see mixed statuses?

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

If working correctly:
```
Console:
  🔍 Filtering: 59 total → 3 matching
  Sample filtered bills: [
    {number: "SB123", status: "Enacted", ...},
    {number: "HB456", status: "Enacted", ...},
    {number: "SB789", status: "Enacted", ...}
  ]

Table Header: Bills (3)
Table Rows: Exactly 3 rows visible
All 3 rows: Have status "Enacted"
```

## 🐛 Possible Bugs

### Bug 1: Filters Not Updating
**Symptom**: Console shows `→ 59 matching` no matter what you select

**Cause**: The `filters` state isn't updating when you check boxes

**Check**: Look at "Active filters" in console - do you see your selections?

### Bug 2: Filtering Logic Wrong
**Symptom**: Console shows correct filters but wrong count

**Cause**: The filter logic has a bug

**Check**: Look at "Sample filtered bills" - do they match the criteria?

### Bug 3: Table Receiving Wrong Data
**Symptom**: Console shows `→ 3 matching` but table shows 59 rows

**Cause**: The table is receiving `bills` instead of `filteredBills`

**This is the most likely cause!**

## 🔧 Quick Fix Test

Let me verify the table is receiving the right data. Can you:

1. Apply the filters (CT + CLINICAL SKILL-BUILDING + 2025 + Enacted)
2. Look at console
3. Tell me:
   - What "Filtering" line says
   - What table header says
   - How many rows you see
   - What the "Sample filtered bills" shows

This will tell me exactly where the bug is!

## 💡 Expected Flow

```
User checks filter
    ↓
FilterPanel calls onFilterChange
    ↓
App updates `filters` state
    ↓
useMemo detects filter change
    ↓
Recalculates `filteredBills` (logs to console)
    ↓
BillsTable receives `filteredBills` prop
    ↓
Table sorts and displays ONLY filtered bills
```

If ANY step breaks, you'll see all bills instead of filtered ones.
