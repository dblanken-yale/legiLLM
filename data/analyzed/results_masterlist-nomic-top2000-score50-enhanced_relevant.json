By providing medical services to this population, the bill indirectly impacts seriously ill patients who may require palliative care services, as it includes benefits identical to those provided under the Health Benefits Service Package, potentially covering palliative care needs.",
      "summary": "HB1570 establishes the Healthy Illinois for All Law, allowing the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to provide medical services to noncitizens aged 19 to 41 with incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. This expansion of medical services may indirectly benefit seriously ill patients by improving access to necessary healthcare, including palliative care services, for a previously underserved population.",
