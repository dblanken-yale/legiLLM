This example is not intended to be exhaustive.\n(g) A transfer on death deed using the phrase \"pay on death to\" or\nthe abbreviation \"POD\" may not be construed to require the liquidation\nof the real property being transferred.\n(h) This section does not preclude other methods of conveying real\nproperty that are permitted by law and have the effect of postponing\nenjoyment of an interest in real property until after the death of the\nowner. This section applies only to transfer on death deeds and does\nnot invalidate any deed that is otherwise effective by law to convey title\nto the interest and estates provided in the deed.\n(i) The endorsement of the county auditor under IC 36-2-11-14 and\nIC 36-2-9-18 is necessary to record a transfer on death deed under this\nsection.\n(j) For a transfer on death deed executed after December 31, 2024,\nJune 30, 2025, the transfer on death deed may include the following\nwarning:\n\"WARNING: After the death of the owner, the owner's insurance\npolicy is required by IC 27-1-13-18 to cover the real property\ntransferred for a period of time as set forth in IC 27-1-13-18(e)\nand IC 27-1-13-18(f).

A dealer may not declare an average percentage parts\nmarkup or average labor rate more than once in a twelve (12) month\nperiod.

If the trial was to the court,\n4 or the judgment was entered on a guilty plea, the court alone shall\n5 conduct the sentencing hearing. The jury or the court may consider all\n6 the evidence introduced at the trial stage of the proceedings, together\n7 with new evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. The court shall\n8 instruct the jury concerning the statutory penalties for murder and any\n9 other offenses for which the defendant was convicted, the potential for\n10 consecutive or concurrent sentencing, and the availability of\n11 educational credit, good time credit, and clemency. The court shall\n12 instruct the jury that, in order for the jury to recommend to the court\n13 that the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole should be\n14 imposed, the jury must find at least one (1) aggravating circumstance\n15 beyond a reasonable doubt as described in subsection (l) (h) and shall\n16 provide a special verdict form for each aggravating circumstance\n17 alleged. The defendant may present any additional evidence relevant\n18 to:\n19 (1) the aggravating circumstances alleged; or\n20 (2) any of the mitigating circumstances listed in subsection (c).\n21 (e) For a defendant sentenced after June 30, 2002, except as\n22 provided by IC 35-36-9, if the hearing is by jury, the jury shall\n23 recommend to the court whether the death penalty or life imprisonment\n24 without parole or neither, should be imposed. The jury may recommend\n25 (1) the death penalty; or\n26 (2) life imprisonment without parole\n27 only if it makes the findings described in subsection (l). (h). If the jury\n28 reaches a sentencing recommendation, the court shall sentence the\n29 defendant accordingly. After a court pronounces sentence, a\n30 representative of the victim's family and friends may present a\n31 statement regarding the impact of the crime on family and friends. The\n32 impact statement may be submitted in writing or given orally by the\n33 representative.

(h).\n2025 IN 1030\u2014LS 6470/DI 92\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n18\n1 (h) If a court sentences a defendant to death, the court shall order\n2 the defendant's execution to be carried out not later than one (1) year\n3 and one (1) day after the date the defendant was convicted. The\n4 supreme court has exclusive jurisdiction to stay the execution of a\n5 death sentence. If the supreme court stays the execution of a death\n6 sentence, the supreme court shall order a new date for the defendant's\n7 execution.\n8 (i) If a person sentenced to death by a court files a petition for\n9 post-conviction relief, the court, not later than ninety (90) days after the\n10 date the petition is filed, shall set a date to hold a hearing to consider\n11 the petition. If a court does not, within the ninety (90) day period, set\n12 the date to hold the hearing to consider the petition, the court's failure\n13 to set the hearing date is not a basis for additional post-conviction\n14 relief. The attorney general shall answer the petition for post-conviction\n15 relief on behalf of the state. At the request of the attorney general, a\n16 prosecuting attorney shall assist the attorney general. The court shall\n17 enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the\n18 petition not later than ninety (90) days after the date the hearing\n19 concludes. However, if the court determines that the petition is without\n20 merit, the court may dismiss the petition within ninety (90) days\n21 without conducting a hearing under this subsection.\n22 (j) A death sentence is subject to automatic review by the supreme\n23 court. The review, which shall be heard under rules adopted by the\n24 supreme court, shall be given priority over all other cases. The supreme\n25 court's review must take into consideration all claims that the:\n26 (1) conviction or sentence was in violation of the:\n27 (A) Constitution of the State of Indiana; or\n28 (B) Constitution of the United States;\n29 (2) sentencing court was without jurisdiction to impose a\n30 sentence; and\n31 (3) sentence:\n32 (A) exceeds the maximum sentence authorized by law; or\n33 (B) is otherwise erroneous.\n34 If the supreme court cannot complete its review by the date set by the\n35 sentencing court for the defendant's execution under subsection (h), the\n36 supreme court shall stay the execution of the death sentence and set a\n37 new date to carry out the defendant's execution.\n38 (k) A person who has been sentenced to death and who has\n39 completed state post-conviction review proceedings may file a written\n40 petition with the supreme court seeking to present new evidence\n41 challenging the person's guilt or the appropriateness of the death\n42 sentence if the person serves notice on the attorney general. The\n2025 IN 1030\u2014LS 6470/DI 92\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n19\n1 supreme court shall determine, with or without a hearing, whether the\n2 person has presented previously undiscovered evidence that\n3 undermines confidence in the conviction or the death sentence. If\n4 necessary, the supreme court may remand the case to the trial court for\n5 an evidentiary hearing to consider the new evidence and its effect on\n6 the person's conviction and death sentence. The supreme court may not\n7 make a determination in the person's favor nor make a decision to\n8 remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing without\n9 first providing the attorney general with an opportunity to be heard on\n10 the matter.\n11 (l) (h) Before a sentence may be imposed under this section, the\n12 jury, in a proceeding under subsection (e), or the court, in a proceeding\n13 under subsection (g), must find that:\n14 (1) the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at least\n15 one (1) of the aggravating circumstances listed in subsection (b)\n16 exists; and\n17 (2) any mitigating circumstances that exist are outweighed by the\n18 aggravating circumstance or circumstances.\n2025 IN 1030\u2014LS 6470/DI 92\n"
