The workforce provisions for personal services attendants and direct support professionals enhance the quality and availability of in-home care, which is critical for palliative care delivery. The establishment of ombudsman roles and appeals processes strengthens patient rights and protections for vulnerable populations.

If a temporary emergency assistance payment is issued to a\n38 provider, managed care organizations are still required to meet contract\n39 obligations for reviewing and paying claims, specifically claims that\n40 total a payment in excess of the temporary emergency assistance\n41 payment reconciliation. However, if a managed care organization fails\n42 to comply with a directive of the office of Medicaid policy and\nHB 1592\u2014LS 7564/DI 104\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n21\n1 planning under subsection (j) to provide a temporary emergency\n2 assistance payment to a provider, the failure of the managed care\n3 organization:\n4 (1) is a violation of the claim processi ng requirements of the\n5 managed care organization's contract; and\n6 (2) makes the managed care organization subject to the penalties\n7 set forth in the contract, including payment of interest on the\n8 amount of the unpaid temporary emergency assistance at the rate\n9 set forth in IC 12-15-21-3(7)(A).\nHB 1592\u2014LS 7564/DI 104\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n22\nCOMMITTEE REPORT\nMr. Speaker: Your Committee on Public Health, to which was\nreferred House Bill 1592, has had the same under consideration and\nbegs leave to report the same back to the House with the\nrecommendation that said bill do pass. \n(Reference is to HB 1592 as introduced.) \nBARRETT\nCommittee Vote: Yeas 12, Nays 0         \nHB 1592\u2014LS 7564/DI 104\n"

By altering reimbursement rates and funding mechanisms for hospitals, including nonprofit systems that provide a substantial portion of care to seriously ill patients, the bill influences hospital capacity to offer comprehensive care including palliative services. The mandated pricing study and nonprofit hospital pricing caps may encourage cost containment and potentially impact resource allocation for specialty services.

Establishes: (1) a state directed payment program (program) for hospitals; and (2) a managed care assessment fee. Changes disproportionate share payments when a state directed payment program is in effect. Allows the incremental hospital fee fund to be used to fund the Medicaid program. Requires a nonprofit hospital system to submit audited financial statements. Provides for a $10,000 per day penalty for failure to submit the hospital's financial statements. Requires the office of management and budget (office) to: (1) develop a methodology to be used in conducting a study of commercial inpatient hospital prices and outpatient hospital prices; and (2) upon budget committee review, conduct the study to determine Indiana's statewide average inpatient and outpatient hospital prices. Requires the office to submit a report of the study to the governor and general assembly. Before June 30, 2029, requires an Indiana nonprofit hospital system's aggregate average inpatient and outpatient hospital prices to at least be equal to or less than the statewide average. States that a violation by the Indiana nonprofit hospital system results in a forfeiture of its nonprofit status. Requires, before October 1 of each year, every nonprofit hospital to provide the Indiana department of health with specified federally filed forms and specified data used to complete the forms. Requires the Indiana department of health to submit these forms to the health care cost oversight task force and impose a fine of $10,000 per day on a nonprofit hospital for failure to submit the nonprofit hospital's forms. Provides an exemption from health care billing requirements for a facility located in a specified populated municipality. Requires a third party administrator to disclose commissions and fees to policyholders in a separate notification. Requires an insurer and a health maintenance organization to submit specified data information to the all payer claims data base. Requires an insurance producer or third party administrator to, before or at the time of sale, provide the plan sponsor with a statement from the insurer or health maintenance organization, disclosing commissions and fees that the insurance producer or third party administrator will receive. Changes the time frame in which certain information and claims data must be submitted to a contract holder as part of an audit or claims data request. Sets requirements for certain hospitals concerning a direct to employer health care arrangement. Beginning January 1, 2026, requires a state employee health plan, a policy of accident and sickness insurance, and a health maintenance organization contract to provide a plan sponsor with the national average drug acquisition cost of a generic drug. States that if an agreement between a health plan and a pharmacy benefit manager provides that less than 85% of the estimated rebates will be deducted from the cost of prescription drugs before a covered individual's cost sharing requirement is determined, the pharmacy benefit manager must provide the policyholder with an annual notice that includes: (1) an explanation of what a rebate is; (2) an explanation of how rebates accrue to the health plan from the manufacturer; and (3) the aggregate amount of rebates that accrued to the health plan for prescription drugs dispensed under the policyholder's health plan for the previous year. Places limitations on hospital health provider contracts linking to or negotiating reimbursement or terms under a separate hospital health care provider contract or product. Requires the office to: (1) study the effect, including the fiscal impact, of requiring physician reimbursement rates under a commercial policy to be set at a minimum reimbursement rate; and (2) report its findings under the study. Requires certain health carriers to provide claims data to a contract holder not more than four times per year (current law allows for the provision of the data twice annually). Requires certain insurers and health maintenance organizations to file specified information concerning changes in hospital reimbursement to the department of insurance.\nStatus: 4\nStatus Date: 2025-05-06\nSponsors: Martin Carbaugh, Julie McGuire, Ben Smaltz\n\nBill Text (Version: Enrolled):\n--- Page 1 ---\nFirst Reg ular Sessio n of the 124th General A ssem bly (2025)\nPRINTING CODE.

While it does not explicitly mention palliative care, the provisions on utilization review, authorization timelines, and prohibitions on denial based on out-of-network referrals impact how palliative care services are authorized and reimbursed. The bill's focus on streamlining prior authorization processes and ensuring timely decisions can reduce barriers to palliative care access and continuity.",
      "summary": "SB0480 establishes comprehensive prior authorization requirements for health plans and utilization review entities, including prohibiting prior authorization for the first 12 physical therapy or chiropractic visits per episode of care and mandating timely responses to authorization requests. It prohibits denial of claims solely due to out-of-network referring providers and requires transparency and reporting on prior authorization decisions. These changes indirectly facilitate improved access and payment processes for palliative care and other services for seriously ill patients statewide by reducing administrative delays and denials.",

The prohibition on denying claims based solely on out-of-network referrals supports continuity of care for patients who may see specialty palliative providers outside narrow networks. Timely authorization decisions and peer review requirements improve the likelihood that symptom management, rehabilitation, and supportive therapies integral to palliative care are approved without undue delay.

These provisions benefit patients, providers, and health plans across Indiana healthcare settings, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and home-based care.",

Increased reimbursement rates and stable funding mechanisms may enhance access to and quality of palliative care services within hospital and managed care settings. The establishment of quality measures and fee formulas creates opportunities to incorporate palliative care-related metrics and incentivize high-quality care.
