Beneficiaries include patients with serious illness across all settings (hospital, home, nursing home), palliative care specialists whose recommendations gain stronger coverage protection, and family caregivers who experience reduced burden from insurance denials and delays.

The bill impacts pediatric patients and their families by improving geographic access to specialized hospice services in the Danbury region. Healthcare providers at Regional Hospice will be able to expand their pediatric program, potentially hiring additional specialized staff or developing new service lines.

The infrastructure development funded by this bill may create capacity for consultation services, symptom management, and family support that extends beyond traditional hospice eligibility. Additionally, expansion of a regional pediatric hospice program can serve as a training site for healthcare professionals learning pediatric serious illness care, indirectly building workforce capacity.",
