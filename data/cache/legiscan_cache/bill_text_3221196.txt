10 inflammation;

12 Indiana Administrative Code 405 IAC 5-28-11 which states in
13 part, " Hyperbaric oxygen therapy shall be clinically practical
14 and shall not be a replacement for other standard  successful
15 therapeutic measures." ; 
16 Whereas, The use of HBOT in Indiana requires a treatment
17 plan submissi on to the Indiana Department of Health, including
