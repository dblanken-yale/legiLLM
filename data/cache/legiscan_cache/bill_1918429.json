  "description": "Health matters. Specifies that the Medicaid fraud control unit's (MFCU) investigation of Medicaid fraud may include the investigation of provider fraud, insurer fraud, duplicate billing, and other instances of fraud. Permits the attorney general to enter into a data sharing agreement with specified state agencies and authorizes the MFCU to analyze this data to carry out its investigative duties. Provides that all complaints made to the MFCU are confidential until an action is filed concerning the complaint. Requires the office of the secretary of family and social services to establish: (1) metrics to assess the quality of care and patient outcomes; and (2) transparency and accountability safeguards; for a specified long term care risk based managed care program. Requires, not later than July 31, 2026, a clinical laboratory and diagnostic imaging facility to post certain pricing information for services determined by the department of insurance. Allows: (1) a manufacturer to provide; and (2) a patient to receive; individualized investigational treatment if certain conditions are met. Requires an Indiana nonprofit hospital system to report a list of facilities that may submit a bill on an institutional provider form and report the facility code for each facility. Adds provisions concerning payments by insurers, health maintenance organizations, employers, and other responsible persons to qualified providers that are providing services in an office setting. Requires good faith estimates for health care services to be provided at least two business days (rather than five business days) before the health care services are scheduled to be provided. Removes language concerning the disclosure of a trade secret from provisions that allow for a health plan sponsor to access and audit claims data. Provides that when a health carrier is in the process of negotiating a health provider contract with a health provider facility or provider, the health carrier must provide certain information to the health provider facility or provider. Prohibits certain provisions from being included in a health provider contract. Allows the department of insurance to: (1) enter into partnerships and joint ventures to encourage best practices in the appropriate and effective use of prior authorization in health care; and (2) receive information regarding prior authorization disputes. Requires the department of insurance to prepare a report with findings and recommendations related to the prior authorization dispute information. Requires, not later than September 1, 2025, the department of insurance to issue a request for information concerning ways to better enable medical consumers to compare and shop for medical and health care services. Provides that an insurer or a health maintenance organization may not deny a claim for reimbursement on the sole basis that the referring provider is an out of network provider. Requires, if a fully credentialed physician becomes employed with another employer or establishes or relocates a medical practice in Indiana, an insurer and health maintenance organization to provisionally credential the physician for 60 days or until the physician is fully credentialed, whichever is earlier. Requires the Indiana department of health, in consultation with the office of technology, to study the feasibility of developing certain standards regarding medical records and data.",
