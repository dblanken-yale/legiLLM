5 (1) The committee establishes a fee formula to be used to fund the
6 state share of the following expenses described in this
7 subdivision:
8 (A) The state share of the capitated payments made to a
9 managed care organization that contracts with the office to
10 provide health coverage under the plan to plan enrollees other

31 service that was in effect before the implementation of the plan
32 and the amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the

1 (B) the amounts used to fund the state share of the costs of the

7 The fees collected under for the purposes of subdivision (1)(A)
8 through (1)(F) and subsection (d) shall be deposited into the
9 incremental hospital fee fund established by section 13.5 of this
10 chapter. The fees used for purposes of funding the state share of

29 inpatient and outpatient services under the state directed
30 payment program shall be established at the maximum rates
31 permitted by federal Medicaid law, subject to available state
32 share funding. At a minimum, the reimbursement rates for
33 such services must be greater than Medicare reimbursement
34 rates. The reimbursement rates may not be established at

41 and 42 CFR 438.6(c)(2)(ii)(I).
