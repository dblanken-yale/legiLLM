  "description": "Parent's bill of rights. Provides that a governmental entity may not substantially burden certain parental rights unless the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering the governmental interest. Prohibits a governmental entity from: (1) advising, directing, or coercing a child to withhold certain information from the child's parent; or (2) denying a child's parent access to certain information. Allows a parent to bring an action against a person for certain violations and provides for certain relief. Specifies that the parent of a child does not have a right to access certain medical care on behalf of the child if the child does not have an affirmative right of access to the medical care. Provides that a person must obtain parental consent and comply with all other medical consent requirements before providing health care to a child. Requires a licensing authority to conduct an immediate investigation and take appropriate disciplinary action if the licensing authority receives information that a person did not obtain appropriate consent. Requires a court to notify the appropriate regulatory authority and the attorney general if the court finds that a person has knowingly provided health care to a minor without first obtaining the appropriate consent.",
