DIGEST OF  INTRODUCED B ILL
Citations Affected:  IC 12-15-41.
Synopsis:  Medicaid buy-in. Amends the definition of "countable
resources" for purposes of the Medicaid buy-in program (program).
Removes consideration of income in determining an individual's
eligibility for participation in the program. Requires the office of the
secretary of family and social services (office of the secretary) to apply
for a state plan amendment or waiver to implement this provision.
Increases the maximum age to be eligible for participation in the
program from 64 years of age to 67 years of age. Allows a recipient's
participation in an employment network recognized by the federal
Social Security Administration to qualify as participating with an
approved provider of employment services. Changes the monthly
maximum premium that a recipient must pay. Requires that the
premium scale be promulgated by administrative rule. Allows the
office of the secretary to annually review the premium amount that a
recipient must pay in the program. (Current law requires annual review
of the premium amount.) Specifies changes in circumstances that must
result in an adjustment of the premium. Specifies that a recipient in the
program is eligible for the same services as offered in the Medicaid
program. States that an individual's participation in the program does
not preclude the individual from participating in a Medicaid waiver
program. Specifies that a recipient of the program may simultaneously
participate in a Medicaid waiver program and requires the office of the
secretary to individually determine eligibility for both programs based
on the individual's medical need requirements.
Effective:  July 1, 2025.
