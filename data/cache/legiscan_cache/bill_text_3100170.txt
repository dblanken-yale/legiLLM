1 subsection (c). For purposes of the program established under this

4 period by the provider to a managed care organization exceeds
5 fifteen percent (15%) of claims submitted appropriately by the
6 provider to the managed care organization under the risk based

9 submitting claims to a managed care organization under the risk
10 based managed care program, has not received payment for at
11 least twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in aggregate claims
12 from the managed care organization;
13 (3) when, in the determination of the director, the claim

21 assistance under the program established under subsection (g), a
22 provider:
23 (1) must have participated in the claims submission testing period
24 conducted under subsection (d) for all managed care
25 organizations with which the provider is contracted under the risk
26 based managed care program established under subsection (c);

32 (B) Evidence that the provider's billing staff participated in
33 claims submission education and training offered through the
34 risk based managed care program established under subsection
35 (c).
36 (C) Evidence that the provider participated in the claims
37 submission testing period conducted under subsection (d) for
38 all managed care organizations with which the provider is
39 contracted under the risk based managed care program

41 (D) Evidence of a consistent effort by the provider to submit
42 claims in accordance with the uniform billing requirements
HB 1592—LS 7564/DI 104


--- Page 22 ---
20
1 developed under subsection (e)(1).
2 (i) The office of Medicaid policy and planning:
3 (1) shall determine whether a provider is experiencing a financial
4 emergency based upon the provider's submission of a written
5 request that meets the requirements of subsection (h)(2); and
6 (2) shall make a determination whether a provider is experiencing
7 a financial emergency not more than seven (7) calendar days after
8 it receives a written request  submitted by a provider under
9 subsection (h)(2).
10 (j) If the office of Medicaid policy and planning determines that a
11 provider is experiencing a financial emergency for purposes of the
12 program established under subsection (g), it shall direct each managed
13 care organization with which the provider is contracted under the risk
14 based managed care program established under subsection (c) to
15 provide a temporary emergency assistance payment to the provider. A
16 managed care organization directed to provide a temporary emergency
17 assistance payment to a provider under this subsection shall provide the
18 payment in not more than seven (7) calendar days after the office
19 directs the managed care organization to provide the payment. The
20 amount of the temporary emergency assistance payment that a managed
21 care organization shall make to a provider under this subsection is
22 equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the monthly average of the
23 provider's long-term services and supports Medicaid claims for the six
24 (6) month period immediately preceding the implementation of the risk
25 based managed care program under subsection (c), adjusted in
26 proportion to the ratio of the managed care organization's covered
27 population membership to the total covered population membership of
28 the risk based managed care program established under subsection (c).
29 (k) Upon issuing any payment of a temporary emergency assistance
30 to a provider under subsection (j), a managed care organization shall
31 set up a receivable to reconcile the temporary emergency assistance
32 funds with actual claims payment amounts. A managed care
33 organization shall reconcile the temporary emergency assistance
34 payment funds with actual claims payment amounts on the first day of
35 the month that is more than thirty-one (31) days after the managed care
36 organization issues the temporary emergency assistance funds to the
37 provider. If a temporary emergency assistance payment is issued to a
38 provider, managed care organizations are still required to meet contract
39 obligations for reviewing and paying claims, specifically claims that
40 total a payment in excess of the temporary emergency assistance
41 payment reconciliation. However, if a managed care organization fails
42 to comply with a directive of the office of Medicaid policy and
HB 1592—LS 7564/DI 104


--- Page 23 ---
21
1 planning under subsection (j) to provide a temporary emergency
2 assistance payment to a provider, the failure of the managed care
3 organization:
4 (1) is a violation of the claim processi ng requirements of the
5 managed care organization's contract; and
6 (2) makes the managed care organization subject to the penalties
7 set forth in the contract, including payment of interest on the
8 amount of the unpaid temporary emergency assistance at the rate
9 set forth in IC 12-15-21-3(7)(A).
