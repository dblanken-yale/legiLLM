DIGEST OF  INTRODUCED B ILL
Citations Affected:  IC 16-21-2-17; IC 16-36-1-5.
Synopsis:  Health care matters. Requires a hospital to inform a woman
in premature labor of the hospital's capabilities of treating the born
alive infant and managing a high risk pregnancy and, if the hospital's
capabilities interfere with the woman's care, the hospital must provide
this information before the woman is admitted to the hospital. Provides
that if a born alive infant is transported to a hospital with an
appropriate perinatal level of care, the woman must be offered an
opportunity to be transported to the same hospital. Provides that if the
local prosecuting attorney has probable cause to believe that a health
care provider may have knowingly or intentionally: (1) violated the
requirements concerning the treatment and care of a born alive infant
or mother or the professional standards of practice through the health
care provider's actions or inactions; and (2) caused harm or death to the
born alive infant or mother; the prosecuting attorney shall investigate
the health care provider for appropriate criminal prosecution.
Establishes a presumption that the continuation of life is in a minor's
best interests. Requires a health care provider to obtain the consent of
each parent or each legal guardian before issuing a do not resuscitate
order or otherwise withholding or withdrawing treatment to allow the
natural death of a minor. Prohibits a health care provider from
interfering with the transfer of a minor patient at the request of a parent
or guardian or otherwise preventing life saving measures before or
during the transfer. States that a court does not have jurisdiction to
withdraw life sustaining treatment for a minor. 
Effective:  July 1, 2025.
