vehicle to fail to compensate a dealer anything less than the dealer's
retail rate for the parts or labor the dealer uses in performing the

charges for parts used in warranty like repairs by the dealer's total cost
for those parts minus one (1) in the lesser of one hundred (100)
customer paid sequential repair orders or ninety (90) consecutive days

eighty (180) days before the date the dealer submits the declaration.
(c) The dealer's submission for retail rates must include a
declaration of the dealer's retail rates for parts or labor along with the
supporting service repair orders paid by customers. A manufacturer or
distributor may challenge the dealer's declaration by submitting a
rebuttal not later than sixty (60) days after the date the declaration was

dealer the average markup on the cost for the part or component as
listed in the manufacturer's or distributor's initial or original price
schedule minus the cost for the part or component.
(h) A manufacturer or distributor may not require a dealer to
establish the retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts or
labor by an unduly burdensome or time consuming method or by
requiring information that is unduly burdensome or time consuming to
provide, including part by part or transaction by transaction
calculations. A dealer may not declare an average percentage parts
markup or average labor rate more than once in a twelve (12) month
period. A manufacturer or distributor may perform annual audits to
verify that a dealer's effective rates have not decreased. If a dealer's
effective rates have decreased, a manufacturer or distributor may
reduce the warranty reimbursement rate prospectively. A dealer may
elect to revert to the nonretail rate reimbursement for parts or labor not
more than once in a twelve (12) month period.

dealer for the purpose of recovering any of its costs related to the
reimbursement of a dealer for parts or labor required under this section.

course of business.

within the office of the secretary of state, the warranty reimbursement
rate in effect before any mediation or complaint remains in effect until
thirty (30) days after:

and
(2) all appeals have been exhausted.
