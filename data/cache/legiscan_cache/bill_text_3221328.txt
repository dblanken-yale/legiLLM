that fiscal year under IC 12-15-19-1 by a percentage sufficient to
compensate for the aggregate reduction in federal financial
participation. If additional federal financial participation is
subseq uently approved with respect to payments into the Medicaid
indigent care trust fund for the same fiscal year, the office shall
