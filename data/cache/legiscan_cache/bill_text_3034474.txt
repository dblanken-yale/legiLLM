1 (8) Any other circumstances appropriate for consideration.
2 (d) If the defendant was convicted of murder in a jury trial, the jury
3 shall reconvene for the sentencing hearing. If the trial was to the court,
4 or the judgment was entered on a guilty plea, the court alone shall
5 conduct the sentencing hearing. The jury or the court may consider all
6 the evidence introduced at the trial stage of the proceedings, together
7 with new evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. The court shall
8 instruct the jury concerning the statutory penalties for murder and any
9 other offenses for which the defendant was convicted, the potential for
10 consecutive or concurrent sentencing, and the availability of
11 educational credit, good time credit, and clemency. The court shall
12 instruct the jury that, in order for the jury to recommend to the court
13 that the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole should be
14 imposed, the jury must find at least one (1) aggravating circumstance
15 beyond a reasonable doubt as described in subsection (l) (h) and shall
16 provide a special verdict form for each aggravating circumstance
17 alleged. The defendant may present any additional evidence relevant
18 to:
19 (1) the aggravating circumstances alleged; or
20 (2) any of the mitigating circumstances listed in subsection (c).
21 (e) For a defendant sentenced after June 30, 2002, except as
22 provided by IC 35-36-9, if the hearing is by jury, the jury shall
23 recommend to the court whether the death penalty or life imprisonment
24 without parole or neither, should be imposed. The jury may recommend
25 (1) the death penalty; or
26 (2) life imprisonment without parole
27 only if it makes the findings described in subsection (l). (h). If the jury
28 reaches a sentencing recommendation, the court shall sentence the
29 defendant accordingly. After a court pronounces sentence, a
30 representative of the victim's family and friends may present a
31 statement regarding the impact of the crime on family and friends. The
32 impact statement may be submitted in writing or given orally by the
33 representative. The statement shall be given in the presence of the
34 defendant.
35 (f) If a jury is unable to agree on a sentence recommendation after
36 reasonable deliberations, the court shall discharge the jury and proceed

1 (h) If a court sentences a defendant to death, the court shall order
2 the defendant's execution to be carried out not later than one (1) year
3 and one (1) day after the date the defendant was convicted. The
4 supreme court has exclusive jurisdiction to stay the execution of a
5 death sentence. If the supreme court stays the execution of a death
6 sentence, the supreme court shall order a new date for the defendant's
7 execution.
8 (i) If a person sentenced to death by a court files a petition for
9 post-conviction relief, the court, not later than ninety (90) days after the
10 date the petition is filed, shall set a date to hold a hearing to consider
11 the petition. If a court does not, within the ninety (90) day period, set
12 the date to hold the hearing to consider the petition, the court's failure
13 to set the hearing date is not a basis for additional post-conviction
14 relief. The attorney general shall answer the petition for post-conviction
15 relief on behalf of the state. At the request of the attorney general, a
16 prosecuting attorney shall assist the attorney general. The court shall
17 enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the
18 petition not later than ninety (90) days after the date the hearing
19 concludes. However, if the court determines that the petition is without
20 merit, the court may dismiss the petition within ninety (90) days
21 without conducting a hearing under this subsection.
22 (j) A death sentence is subject to automatic review by the supreme
23 court. The review, which shall be heard under rules adopted by the
24 supreme court, shall be given priority over all other cases. The supreme
25 court's review must take into consideration all claims that the:
26 (1) conviction or sentence was in violation of the:
27 (A) Constitution of the State of Indiana; or
28 (B) Constitution of the United States;
29 (2) sentencing court was without jurisdiction to impose a
30 sentence; and
31 (3) sentence:
32 (A) exceeds the maximum sentence authorized by law; or
33 (B) is otherwise erroneous.
34 If the supreme court cannot complete its review by the date set by the
35 sentencing court for the defendant's execution under subsection (h), the
36 supreme court shall stay the execution of the death sentence and set a
37 new date to carry out the defendant's execution.
38 (k) A person who has been sentenced to death and who has
39 completed state post-conviction review proceedings may file a written
40 petition with the supreme court seeking to present new evidence
41 challenging the person's guilt or the appropriateness of the death
42 sentence if the person serves notice on the attorney general. The
2025 IN 1030—LS 6470/DI 92


--- Page 20 ---
19
1 supreme court shall determine, with or without a hearing, whether the
2 person has presented previously undiscovered evidence that
3 undermines confidence in the conviction or the death sentence. If
4 necessary, the supreme court may remand the case to the trial court for
5 an evidentiary hearing to consider the new evidence and its effect on
6 the person's conviction and death sentence. The supreme court may not
7 make a determination in the person's favor nor make a decision to
8 remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing without
9 first providing the attorney general with an opportunity to be heard on
10 the matter.
11 (l) (h) Before a sentence may be imposed under this section, the
12 jury, in a proceeding under subsection (e), or the court, in a proceeding
13 under subsection (g), must find that:
14 (1) the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at least
15 one (1) of the aggravating circumstances listed in subsection (b)
16 exists; and
17 (2) any mitigating circumstances that exist are outweighed by the
18 aggravating circumstance or circumstances.
