(f) Subsections (g) through (k) apply during the first two hundred

covered population is implemented under subsection (c).
(g) The office of Medicaid policy and planning shall establish a
temporary emergency financial assistance program for providers that
experience financial emergencies due to claims payment issues while
participating in the risk based managed care program established under
subsection (c). For purposes of the program established under this
subsection, a financial emergency exists:

period by the provider to a managed care organization exceeds
fifteen percent (15%) of claims submitted appropriately by the
provider to the managed care organization under the risk based
managed care program;
(2) when the provider, twenty-one (21) days after appropriately
submitting claims to a managed care organization under the risk
based managed care program, has not received payment for at
least twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in aggregate claims
from the managed care organization;
(3) when, in the determination of the director, the claim
submission system of a managed care organization with which the
provider is contracted under the risk based managed care program
experiences failure or overload; or
(4) upon the occurrence of other circumstances that, in the
determination of the director, constitute a financial emergency for
a provider.
(h) To be eligible for a payment of temporary emergency financial
assistance under the program established under subsection (g), a
provider:
(1) must have participated in the claims submission testing period
conducted under subsection (d) for all managed care
organizations with which the provider is contracted under the risk
based managed care program established under subsection (c);
and
(2) must submit to the office of Medicaid policy and planning a
written request that includes all of the following:
(A) Documentation providing evidence of the provider's
financial need for emergency assistance.
HEA 1474 — Concur


--- Page 31 ---
31
(B) Evidence that the provider's billing staff participated in
claims submission education and training offered through the
risk based managed care program established under subsection
(c).
(C) Evidence that the provider participated in the claims
submission testing period conducted under subsection (d) for
all managed care organizations with which the provider is
contracted under the risk based managed care program
established under subsection (c).
(D) Evidence of a consistent effort by the provider to submit
claims in accordance with the uniform billing requirements
developed under subsection (e)(1).
(i) The office of Medicaid policy and planning:
(1) shall determine whether a provider is experiencing a financial
emergency based upon the provider's submission of a written
request that meets the requirements of subsection (h)(2); and
(2) shall make a determination whether a provider is experiencing
a financial emergency not more than seven (7) calendar days after
it receives a written request submitted by a provider under
subsection (h)(2).
(j) If the office of Medicaid policy and planning determines that a
provider is experiencing a financial emergency for purposes of the
program established under subsection (g), it shall direct each managed
care organization with which the provider is contracted under the risk
based managed care program established under subsection (c) to
provide a temporary emergency assistance payment to the provider. A
managed care organization directed to provide a temporary emergency
assistance payment to a provider under this subsection shall provide the
payment in not more than seven (7) calendar days after the office
directs the managed care organization to provide the payment. The
amount of the temporary emergency assistance payment that a managed
care organization shall make to a provider under this subsection is
equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the monthly average of the
provider's long-term services and supports Medicaid claims for the six
(6) month period immediately preceding the implementation of the risk
based managed care program under subsection (c), adjusted in
proportion to the ratio of the managed care organization's covered
population membership to the total covered population membership of
the risk based managed care program established under subsection (c).
(k) Upon issuing any payment of a temporary emergency assistance
to a provider under subsection (j), a managed care organization shall
set up a receivable to reconcile the temporary emergency assistance
HEA 1474 — Concur


--- Page 32 ---
32
funds with actual claims payment amounts. A managed care
organization shall reconcile the temporary emergency assistance
payment funds with actual claims payment amounts on the first day of
the month that is more than thirty-one (31) days after the managed care
organization issues the temporary emergency assistance funds to the
provider. If a temporary emergency assistance payment is issued to a
provider, managed care organizations are still required to meet contract
obligations for reviewing and paying claims, specifically claims that
total a payment in excess of the temporary emergency assistance
payment reconciliation. However, if a managed care organization fails
to comply with a directive of the office of Medicaid policy and
planning under subsection (j) to provide a temporary emergency
assistance payment to a provider, the failure of the managed care
organization:
(1) is a violation of the claim processing requirements of the
managed care organization's contract; and
(2) makes the managed care organization subject to the penalties
set forth in the contract, including payment of interest on the
amount of the unpaid temporary emergency assistance at the rate
set forth in IC 12-15-21-3(7)(A).
