13 the coverage required under subsection (c): (d):
14 (1) may be subject to; and
15 (2) may not be more restrictive than;
16 the provisions that apply to other benefits under the individual contract
17 or group contract.
18 (h) An individual contract or a group contract shall consider the
19 coverage required under subsection (d) to be habilitative or
20 rehabilitative benefits for purposes of any state or federal
21 requirement for coverage of essential health benefits.
22 (f) (i) The coverage required under subsection (c) (d) may be
23 subject to utilization review, including periodic review, of the
24 continued medical necessity of the benefit. An individual contract or
25 a group contract:
26 (1) shall render utilization review determinations in a
27 nondiscriminatory manner; and
28 (2) may not deny coverage for habilitative or rehabilitative
29 benefits, including orthotic devices or prosthetic devices,
30 solely on the basis of an enrollee's actual or perceived
31 disability.
32 (j) An individual contract or a group contract may not deny
33 coverage  for an orthotic device or a prosthetic device for an
34 enrollee with limb loss or absence that would otherwise be covered
35 for an enrollee without a disability who seeks medical or surgical
36 intervention to restore or maintain the ability to perform the same
37 physical activity.
38 (k) An individual contract or a group contract shall include
39 language describing an enrollee's rights under subsections (i) and
40 (j) in the individual contract or group contract's evidence of

1 enrollees have access to medically necessary clinical care and
2 orthotic devices and prosthetic devices from at least two (2) distinct
3 orthotic device and prosthetic device providers in the individual
4 contract or group contract's network. If medically necessary
5 orthotic devices and prosthetic devices are not available from an
6 in network  provider, the individual contract or group contract
7 shall:
8 (1) provide processes to refer an enrollee to an out of network
9 provider; and
10 (2) fully reimburse the out of network provider at a mutually
11 agreed upon rate reduced by the enrollee's cost sharing
12 determined on an in network basis.
13 (m) If an individual contract or a grou p contract provides
14 coverage for an orthotic device or prosthetic device, the individual
15 contract or group contract shall provide coverage for the
16 replacement of the orthotic device, the prosthetic device, or any
17 part of the orthotic device or prosthetic device without regard to
18 continuous use or useful lifetime restrictions if an ordering
19 provider determines that the replacement device or part is
20 necessary because of any of the following:
21 (1) A change in the physiological condition of the enrollee.
22 (2) An irreparable change in the condition of the device or
23 part.
24 (3) The condition of the device or part requires repairs and
25 the cost of the repairs would be more than sixty percent
26 (60%) of the cost of a replacement device or part.
27 The individual contract or group contract may require
28 confirmation from a prescribing provider if the device or part that
29 is being replaced is less than three (3) years old.
30 (g) Any lifetime maximum coverage limitation that applies to
31 prosthetic devices and orthotic devices:
32 (1) must not be included in; and
33 (2) must be equal to;
34 the lifetime maximum coverage limitation that applies to all other items
35 and services generally under the individual contract or group contract.
36 (h) (n) For purposes of this subsection, "items and services" does
37 not include preventive services for which coverage is provided under
38 a high deductible health plan (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 220(c)(2) or 26
39 U.S.C. 223(c)(2)). The coverage required under subsection (c) (d) may
40 not be subject to a deductible, copayment, or coinsurance provision that
41 is less favorable to an enrollee than the deductible, copayment, or
42 coinsurance provisions that apply to other items and services generally
